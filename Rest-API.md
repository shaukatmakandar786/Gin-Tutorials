### Rest API Definition:

Full form of REST API is Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface more commonly known as Rest API web service. 
It means when a RESTful API is called, the server will transfer a representation of the requested resource’s state to the client system.

Here is an example of what a REST API client is. For instance, when a developer requests Twitter API to fetch a user’s object (a resource), 
the API will send back the state of that user, their name, followers, and posts shared on Twitter. This is possible due to API integration.

This representation of the state can be in JSON, XML, or HTML format.
